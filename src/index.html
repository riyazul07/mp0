    <p class="bio">
      I have a strong background in computer science and information systems, with a B.E. from Goa University and an M.S. in progress at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
      I gained professional experience at Tata Consultancy Services, where I built scalable enterprise applications using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL, while also leading DevOps automation and database optimization.

      I have worked on projects including a machine learning model for heart disease prediction and an interactive Formula 1 analytics dashboard in Tableau, which allowed me to apply my skills in data science and visualization.
      With expertise in programming, DevOps, and analytics, I bring a versatile mix of software engineering and data-driven problem-solving to every project I take on.
